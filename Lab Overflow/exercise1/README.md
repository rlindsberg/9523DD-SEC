# Exercise 1

The applications requires two arguments: (1) a username and (2) the
number of chars that should be printed back on screen
```
Use ./main.elf <user> <chars-to-echo>
```
For example
```
./main.elf hello 2
Start
Echo he
End

./main.elf hello 5
Start
Echo hello
End
```

## Problem 1.1

Forge two command line arguments that
make the application to leak the password that is
stored internally.
Write your solution in the file solution1.txt.
For instance, if you used `./main.elf hello 5` to leak the password,
then your `solution1.txt` file should look like
```
# exercise 1
# question 1
# Forge two command line arguments that
# make the application to leak the password that is
# stored internally.
hello 5
# end
```

To test your solution execute =./test.py= or =py.test test.py=.

## Hints
Debug the program using GDB. Find the distance between the
locations of the two internal local variables `name` and `pwd`.
